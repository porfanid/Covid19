            <p>Until 15 June, everyone arriving in Greece from abroad will be tested for coronavirus, and will be required to go into self-isolation. From 15 June, these requirements will change, but you may still be required to participate in testing and self-isolation/quarantine.

                  Greece on Tuesday announced they were suspending flights to and from Qatar until mid-June, after 12 out of 91 passengers in a Qatar Airways flight that landed in Athens on Monday tested positive for the coronavirus.

                  Nine of the infected passengers are Pakistani nationals, coming from the city of Gujrat, who have a Greek residence permit, two are Greek nationals coming from Australia and one person is a Japanese national and member of a Greek-Japanese family, the General Secretariat for Civil Protection said in a press release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  All passengers in the flight from Doha to Athensâ€™ International Airport were tested and quarantined in hotels until they got their results back, in line with the current health protocols.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Those infected will remain in the hotels for two weeks, while those who tested negative will have to stay for seven days as they are considered close high and low risk contacts, the authority said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Health officers will repeat the tests on the passengers who tested negative after a week.
